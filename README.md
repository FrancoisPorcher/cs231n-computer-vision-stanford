# cs231n - Stanford - Computer Vision
Stanford Class of Computer Vision

## Tips
- You should read the classes first before the youtube video because otherwise you get lazy. The pdf files are much more exhaustive than the videos so focus on that.
- Update: I am done with that, let's watch the classes

## Task List
### Module 1 Neural Networks
- [ ] Do the case studies in penultimate class
- [ ] Do the very last class
- [ ] Do the assignments and watch the class videos
- [ ] You are fucking done!

### Module 2 Convolutional Neural Networks

### Assignments:
- [ ] Assignment 1
- [ ] Assignment 2
